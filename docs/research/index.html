		<h1>Current research areas</h1>

<p class="noindent">
Our research is of theoretical and computational nature, and focuses on
mesoscale theories of nonequilibrium phenomena in extended systems, with
applications to Statistical Mechanics, Soft Matter Physics, and Materials
Science. Generically, systems outside of thermodynamic equilibrium involve
unstable interfaces and moving topological defects. We develop theories at the
mesoscale of the relevant phases, analyze their macroscopic scale asymptotics,
and obtain their non equilibrium properties through large scale computation. Our
research is currently motivated by topologically driven flows in liquid
crystals, unstable interfaces in complex fluids, and a mesoscale description of
plasticity in defected materials.

<h2>Self consistent field theory of nematic liquid crystals</h2>
<p class="text">

The nematic phase of a liquid crystal is an equilibrium phase characterized by
long ranged molecular orientational order. Liquid crystal molecules typically
have uniaxial symmetry (head-tail symmetry) and therefore allow defects of half
integer degree. Shown are a defect of +1/2 (left) and -1/2 (right) degree as
indicated by the while lines. The degree of order and the structure of the
defect core have been typically beyond experimental resolution, and therefore
often modeled as effective or point singularities of the (continuous) order
parameter field. Recent experiments in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals have
revealed defect core sizes on a scale of a few microns, and have determined
their spatial structure in some detail.
<br><br>

Neither of the two current theories in use for the description of nematic phases
can address the core structure observed. In one, the ~Oseen-Frank theory,
defects are point singularities of the so called director field, and removed
with appropriate cut-off approaches. In the second, the Landau-de Gennes theory,
the order parameter at the core is phenomenological, and largely isotropic (in
disagreement with experiments). In
<a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/MSPaper.pdf"> [CS20] </a>
we have developed a self consistent field theory of the nematic, which needs to
be solved numerically. As in the Landau-de Gennes theory, our approach is based
on a tensor order parameter description of the nematic phase. Unlike the latter,
we can guarantee that the eigenvalues of the order parameter remain in the
physically admissible range throughout the defect, as well as allow different
energies for splay and bend distortions while retaining boundedness of the
energy. This is also a central feature of the molecular interactions in this
lyotropic liquid crystal.

<h2>Smectic film instabilities</h2>
<p class="text">

<img src="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/tspot_files/smectic_web.png"
class="float-left" width="250"> A smectic is a complex fluid phase of a 
liquid crystal that exhibits broken
translational symmetry in only one direction (a one dimensional solid or a
layered phase). Interfaces separating smectic and isotropic phases in
equilibrium can be quite complex, such as the array of focal conics shown left.
Such an equilibrium shape depends on the complex interplay between mean and
Gaussian curvatures, and bending and torsion energies. These are effects largely
absent in normal fluid or solid phases. We are investigating an order parameter
model of the smectic-isotropic system that can describe the equilibrium
thermodynamics of its complex interfacial morphologies as a function of
intrinsic metric properties of the interface. The same model can then be
extended to describe surface instabilities and the ensuing pattern formation.
The model is especially useful in describing instabilities in which the topology
of the domains change as a function of time. The figure at left shows an
evolving surface pattern in three dimensions from an initial toroidal focal
domain. New smectic layers are being formed at the center of the domain by
layer growth from the isotropic phase 
<a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/ev1.pdf"> [EV18] </a>
<br><br>
More generally, local equilibrium thermodynamics is key to the existence of
local (reversible) stresses that drive hydrodynamic flow. Our approach provides
a direct method of computing not only interfacial tension but also bending and
torsion stresses on a moving interface. The combined problem involving
interfacial relaxation and fluid flow has been addressed for a system in which
the local density couples to the local smectic order parameter in order to
describe experiments about instabilities of a smectic air interface.

<h2>Mesoscale theory of defected materials</h2>
<p class="text">

<img
src="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/tspot_files/PFC_amplitude_phase_dipole.png"
class="float-left" width="250"> We are developing a mesoscopic theory of 
defect motion in crystalline solids. It
is based on a continuum order parameter description of the defect density that
incorporates the topological content of a given element of volume, and that can
be used to study defect motion
<a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.014107"> [PE16] </a>. 
Phenomenological
equations of motion that respect topological constraints are developed to
describe the temporal evolution of an ensemble of interacting defects. We have
first shown that our methodology recovers the classical results of plasticity
theory pertaining to defect motion under stress
<a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/as1.pdf"> [AS18]</a>. 
The figure (left)
shows amplitudes and phases of the order parameter for a dislocation dipole in a
hexagonal lattice. Two of three wave amplitudes of the order parameter decay to
zero in the defect core region, whereas the phase exhibits a discontinuity along
a line joining the cores. These solutions are not imposed as in classical
treatments; rather they appear as a direct solution of the mesoscopic theory.
<br><br>
The theory has been used to analyze non equilibrium dislocation motion
<a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/as2.pdf"> [AS18b] </a>, showing good
agreement with macroscopic plasticity without requiring any core or singularity
regularization . These results have also been extended to a coarse grained
description <a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/ms1.pdf">
[MS20]</a>,
methodology that alleviates the need to resolve microscopic scales, and allows
computations in large systems. 
<br><br>
Finally, we have clarified shortcomings of previous mesoscale theories of
plastic motion which did not properly account for the necessary independence
between elastic response, mass transport, and order parameter relaxation

<h2>Topology driven flows in nematic suspensions</h2>

The study of of liquid crystal based suspensions is motivated by applications in
materials science as well as in biological systems. At a fundamental level, and
in contrast with normal suspending fluids, nematic order in a liquid crystalline
matrix leads to long range elastic interactions either among colloidal particles
or with bounding walls, resulting in a variety of unexpected phenomena.
Furthermore, long range order in the matrix is distorted by the suspended
particles, resulting in anisotropic response, and  unavoidable topological
defects that must move with the particles. On the one hand, the existence of
structure in the liquid matrix affords new opportunities for flow control,
processing, and suspension stability. At the same time, and for the same
reasons, efficient engineering of these systems requires major advances to our
current understanding of nematic fluid colloids.

The figure above (left) shows the spatial charge distribution induced by a (+1,
-1) disclination pair under a uniform but oscillatory electric field normal to
the line joining the defects. A (+1) disclination represents a suspended
particle with homeotropic anchoring, and the (-1) disclination is the associated
hyperbolic hedgehog. Both defects lead to spatial charge separation which, in
turn, results in streaming flows (figure on the right), resulting in transport
normal to the direction of the applied field
<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sm/c6sm02393b#!divAbstract">
[CO17]</a>. Thus a nematic matrix allows nonlinear anisotropic hydrodynamic 
mobilities.
Effects like this one are being developed to engineer designer flows for use in
microfluidic devices, including particle sorting and aggregation (including cell
sorting), and stirring and the micro scale
<a href="http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.052502">
[PE15]</a>. The
same effects are being investigated to control, dynamically and on demand, the
motion of self-propelled (or active) particles such as swimming bacteria in a
nematic matrix <a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/ck8.pdf">
