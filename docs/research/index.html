		<h1>Current research areas</h1>

<p class="noindent">
Our research is of theoretical and computational nature, and focuses on
mesoscale theories of nonequilibrium phenomena in extended systems, with
applications to Statistical Mechanics, Soft Matter Physics, and Materials
Science. Generically, systems outside of thermodynamic equilibrium involve
unstable interfaces and moving topological defects. We develop theories at the
mesoscale of the relevant phases, analyze their macroscopic scale asymptotics,
and obtain their non equilibrium properties through large scale computation. Our
research is currently motivated by topologically driven flows in liquid
crystals, unstable interfaces in complex fluids, and a mesoscale description of
plasticity in defected materials.

<h2>Self consistent field theory of nematic liquid crystals</h2>
<p class="text">

The nematic phase of a liquid crystal is an equilibrium phase characterized by
long ranged molecular orientational order. Liquid crystal molecules typically
have uniaxial symmetry (head-tail symmetry) and therefore allow defects of half
integer degree. Shown are a defect of +1/2 (left) and -1/2 (right) degree as
indicated by the while lines. The degree of order and the structure of the
defect core have been typically beyond experimental resolution, and therefore
often modeled as effective or point singularities of the (continuous) order
parameter field. Recent experiments in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals have
revealed defect core sizes on a scale of a few microns, and have determined
their spatial structure in some detail.
<br><br>

Neither of the two current theories in use for the description of nematic phases
can address the core structure observed. In one, the ~Oseen-Frank theory,
defects are point singularities of the so called director field, and removed
with appropriate cut-off approaches. In the second, the Landau-de Gennes theory,
the order parameter at the core is phenomenological, and largely isotropic (in
disagreement with experiments). In
<a href="http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~vinals/mss/MSPaper.pdf"> [CS20] </a>
we have developed a self consistent field theory of the nematic, which needs to
be solved numerically. As in the Landau-de Gennes theory, our approach is based
on a tensor order parameter description of the nematic phase. Unlike the latter,
we can guarantee that the eigenvalues of the order parameter remain in the
physically admissible range throughout the defect, as well as allow different
energies for splay and bend distortions while retaining boundedness of the
energy. This is also a central feature of the molecular interactions in this
lyotropic liquid crystal.

		<h2>Block copolymers as a structured material</h2>
		<p class="text">

<img src="../images/zz_example4_thumb.jpg" class="float-left" hspace=10 vspace=5>
Block copolymers are being extensively investigated as nanoscale templates for
a wide variety of applications that include nanolithography, photonic
components, or high density storage systems. However, given the small 
wavelength of the microphases (tens or hundreds of Angstroms), macroscopic 
size samples do not completely order through spontaneous self assembly. 
Instead, oscillatory shears are commonly introduced in order to accelerate 
long range order development over the required distances.
A mesoscopic model of a diblock copolymer is used to study the
formation, stability, and coarsening of lamellar phases, including
their hydrodynamic response to applied external shears. The focus of
our research is on mechanisms controlling long ranged
orientational order, including the motion of grain boundaries or other
topological defects, and the introduction of a mesoscopic theory of
viscoelasticity that can describe the
stability and response of these materials to shears, and account for the
selection of particular orientations depending on the architecture of the
block and the parameters of the shear.

		<h2>Topological defect motion in modulated phases</h2>
		<p class="text">

<img src="../images/lam_3D_thumb.jpg" class="float-left" hspace=10 vspace=5>
Modulated phases are ubiquitous in Nature generally resulting in
systems with competing attractive interactions at short distances, and
long range repulsion. They are generally characterized by some
degree of broken symmetry that is intermediate between fully ordered crystals
and completely disordered fluids. We consider general order parameter models
that are appropriate for a coarse grained description of modulated phases to
address a number of generic non equilibrium features, including slow relaxation
accompanying topological defect motion, the breakdown of continuum
laws of defect motion and the formation of structural glasses, and their
dependence on the symmetry of the phases. We are currently
investigating non potential effects, according to which the evolution
of the system is not simply determined by the minimization of an
appropriate free energy. In particular, we address the consequences of
this assumption on extended defect motion, and the possible transition
to persistent dynamics and spatio temporal chaos.

		<h2>Protein-protein interactions</h2>
		<p class="text">

<img src="../images/2zta_thumb.jpg" class="float-left" hspace=10 vspace=5>
Sequencing of the genomes of several species (including humans) opens
the door to a new understanding of biological function, as well as to
the possible elucidation of the genetic mechanisms of many diseases, and
perhaps to their cure through genetic manipulation. This research aims
at improving current computational methods that predict the three
dimensional structure of proteins and of protein-protein interactions
from the knowledge of their amino acid
sequence. Protein function is more closely related to structure than to
sequence, and hence methodologies that can produce large scale
predictions of protein structure are essential in this post-genomic era.
Reduced, lattice based models of proteins, and Monte Carlo simulation
methods are used to analyze the relationship between sequence and
characteristic structural motifs of the folded protein. Statistical
methods are being develop to increase sensitivity in the detection of
functional sites and to calculate the thermodynamics parameters
that describe protein-protein interactions (formation of dimers, trimers,
etc.). The image shows the dimer of GCN4, currently being
studied by replica Monte Carlo.

		<h2>Faraday waves</h2>
		<p class="text">

<img src="../images/qpattern2_thumb.jpg" class="float-left" hspace=10 vspace=5>
Parametrically driven surface waves (also known as Faraday waves)
can be excited on the
free surface of a fluid layer that is periodically vibrated in the direction
normal to the surface at rest if the amplitude of the driving acceleration is
large enough to overcome the dissipative effect of fluid viscosity.
Despite the simplicity of the
configuration, this system displays a large number of features that are
characteristic of strong nonlinearity, and serves as a prototype of many
nonlinear phenomena that are currently under active investigation. Among them we
mention the discovery of stationary quasi-periodic patterns of surface standing
waves (shown in the figure. This pattern is
the analog of a quasi-crystal in solid state physics),
the transition to spatio temporal chaos, super-lattice patterns in systems
vibrated with two frequency components, coexistence of chaotic and regular
regions in extended systems, serving as a laboratory for detailed studies of
turbulence, or its analysis in unconventional systems such as viscoelastic
fluids or granular materials.
